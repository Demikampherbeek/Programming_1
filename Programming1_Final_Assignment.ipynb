    "From the interactive bokeh plot that has an ascending regression line and the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.582, it can be concluded that there is a moderately correlated relation between IQ score and happiness score. This means IQ score and happiness score are to some degree associated with eachother. Because a lot of factors that contribute to happiness score and IQ score, a higher IQ score is not the sole component that causes happiness. For a next study, other contributing factors to the happiness score like local weather, work quality, gdp etc. can be researched together with happiness score. "
